# PDF-Keyword_Finder
Working on a website that will take a directory of pdf files, check them against a specified list of key words, and return a csv file containing a the key word data and the sentence that it is found in within the pdf document. I use comments throughout the code to explain each step of the process.

There are 2 major commented out sections. The first, is a script to create a list of tuples of keywords and the page they are found within. The second has the same function as the initial keyword finder script except it is able to be run from command line with arguments passed in directly from the terminal.
